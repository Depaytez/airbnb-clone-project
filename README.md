- Prioritize clarity and accessibility
- Use minimalist, distraction-free visuals

### Key Features
- Property search and filter options
- Clear listing cards with pricing and availability
- Detailed property pages with photos and host info
- Simple, guided checkout experience

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page                    | Description                                                                 |

## UI Component Patterns

UI components are reusable building blocks used throughout the application to ensure consistency and modularity.

### Planned Components:
- **Navbar**: Contains navigation links and user authentication status.
- **Property Card**: A compact component to showcase listing image, price, location, and brief description.
- **Footer**: Includes copyright, contact links, and additional site navigation.
